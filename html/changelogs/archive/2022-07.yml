  - rscadd: Adds the Engineering, medical and cargo bandana to departmental clothing
      vendors.

  - rscadd: Bandana sprites now visually show that they are a neckerchief by being
      wide instead of by neckerchief being added to their name.
  - rscadd: Slightly tweaks the purple bandana's color to match the janitor's uniform.
  - bugfix: Bandana sprites can no longer be glitched by dying a bandana while its
      adjusted.

      to vox though.
